# Testing

Input Leaf uses a small, fast JVM test suite and Kover coverage reporting as the main feedback loop for local development and pull requests. Pull-request CI runs two parallel coverage jobs: `fast-jvm` runs the JVM suites (~2–4 minutes) and `android-coverage` runs a small emulator smoke suite (~8–15 minutes normally, ~20–25 minutes with cold caches). Codecov waits for both uploads before publishing the combined project and patch status.

## Requirements

- JDK 17
- Android SDK platform 37.0 and build tools 36.0.0
- The checked-in Gradle Wrapper (`./gradlew`)
- An API 36 Android emulator, only for the instrumented smoke suite

## Run the fast suite

From the repository root, run:

```sh
./gradlew :koverXmlReportDebugJvm
```

The Kover task runs the app's local Android `debug` JVM tests and writes `build/reports/kover/coverage-debug-jvm.xml`. The same task runs in the `fast-jvm` GitHub Actions job.

## Run the instrumented smoke tests

Start an API 36 emulator (or Android Studio's Device Manager), then run:

```sh
./gradlew :app:createDebugCoverageReport
```

This installs the debug and test APKs, runs every instrumented test under `app/src/androidTest`, and writes the JaCoCo XML report to `app/build/reports/coverage/androidTest/debug/connected/report.xml`. The same task runs in the `android-coverage` GitHub Actions job. Debug builds are JaCoCo-instrumented (`enableAndroidTestCoverage = true`), so no extra setup is needed for coverage.

Note that debug builds sign with the project keystore `app/input-leaf.jks`, which is gitignored. CI generates a throwaway keystore with the credentials hardcoded in `app/build.gradle.kts`; on a machine without the project keystore, create one the same way:

```sh
keytool -genkeypair -keystore app/input-leaf.jks -storepass inputleaf123 -keypass inputleaf123 \
  -alias input-leaf -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -dname "CN=Input Leaf"
```

## Build a signed release APK

For distribution from this Synergy fork, build the release variant:

```sh
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
```

The universal APK is written to `app/build/dist/release/`. Release builds are
non-debuggable and have Android/JVM coverage instrumentation disabled. Debug
builds show a `-debug` version suffix and remain suitable for instrumented tests.
Protocol event tracing is enabled only in debug builds.

Use the same gitignored `app/input-leaf.jks` when building updates; generating a
new signing key would prevent installation over existing builds. Never commit or
upload the keystore. The fork's in-app update checker uses
`joihn/input_leaf_synergy`, so it does not direct users to an upstream APK that
lacks the Synergy changes.

Before publishing, verify the release APK's signature and non-debuggable manifest,
and confirm that its signer matches the previous distributed build. GitHub release
notes should identify the source commit and APK SHA-256. Upload only release-variant
APKs to the latest release.

## Test locations and conventions

### Android app

Place app JVM tests under:

```text
app/src/test/java/com/inputleaf/android/<feature>/
```

Mirror the production package, name classes after the subject with a `Test` suffix, and follow the existing JUnit 4, Truth, and behavior-oriented naming conventions. Put deterministic file fixtures in `app/src/test/resources/`.

### Android instrumented smoke tests

Place emulator smoke tests under:

```text
app/src/androidTest/java/com/inputleaf/android/<feature>/
```

Mirror the production package, name classes after the subject, and keep the suite small: these tests run on an emulator in CI on every pull request. They are smoke tests that launch real activities and bind real services to catch integration breakage the JVM suite cannot see — navigation rendering, service binding, lifecycle startup — not full behavioral coverage. Shared fixtures go in `app/src/androidTest/java/com/inputleaf/android/testutil/`.

## Test design principles

- Test observable results, emitted events, persisted values, errors, and protocol bytes rather than private methods or collaborator call order.
- Prefer pure JVM tests over emulator tests when Android behavior is not the subject of the test.
- Control time, asynchronous work, network responses, and fixture data so tests are deterministic.
- Use byte streams, loopback sockets, and small fakes instead of external services, LAN devices, privileged APIs, or physical hardware.
- Give each test independent state and explicit cleanup.
- Do not add retries or arbitrary sleeps to hide flaky behavior.
- Keep fixtures local to a test unless sharing clearly reduces duplication.

## Suite boundaries

The required `fast-jvm` JVM suite must not depend on:

- an Android emulator or connected device;
- a Deskflow installation or external server;
- LAN or Internet access during tests;
- Shizuku, accessibility, or IME access;
- APK signing or release secrets.

The parallel `android-coverage` job runs a small instrumented smoke suite that intentionally exercises the opposite: real activities, real service binding, and real APK installation on an API 36 emulator. It must stay smoke-sized — it runs on every pull request, and emulator startup dominates its wall-clock time. Lint and formatting are not part of the required test commands because the repository does not currently configure dedicated formatting or static-analysis tooling.

## Coverage guardrails

Kover collects coverage from the local Android `debug` JVM tests. The `android-coverage` job collects a JaCoCo report from the connected smoke tests against the instrumented debug APK. Codecov uploads both as XML (`jvm` and `android` flags), waits for both jobs (`after_n_builds: 2` in `codecov.yml`), merges them for reporting, and comments on pull requests with project and changed-line coverage.

Codecov requires 100% patch coverage: every changed executable line must be exercised by one of the suites. This is a regression guardrail, not proof that a feature is behaviorally complete; tests must still assert the relevant observable behavior and edge cases.


## Current baseline

The initial baseline was verified with JDK 17 and Android SDK 34 when the fast CI workflow was introduced; the current baseline is verified with JDK 17 and Android SDK 37.0:

- `:app:testDebugUnitTest` passes and runs the app's Kotlin behavior tests.

The `android-coverage` CI job verifies on the API 36 emulator that `:app:createDebugCoverageReport` passes and runs the service and onboarding smoke tests added with that job.

Before making changes, run the complete fast suite and treat failures as real regressions or document them explicitly. Do not skip, mute, or retry failing tests merely to produce a green build. GitHub Actions retains available test reports when either CI job fails.

## Synergy 3 compatibility

Synergy handshake, TLS, relative-motion, and Mac keycode regression tests run in
the normal JVM suite. The optional `Synergy3LiveTest` is skipped unless explicitly
configured; see [the Synergy 3 guide](synergy3-android.md#development-and-reproduction).
The desktop registration helper uses Python's standard-library test runner:

```sh
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -v
```
